**Placement Prediction Project Readme**

### Overview:

This project aims to predict whether a student will be placed based on various factors such as gender, specialization, work experience, and academic performance. The predictive model is built using machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree classifiers.

### Project Structure:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The dataset (`Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv`) is loaded using the Pandas library.
   - Initial exploration of the dataset using `head()` and `info()` methods.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Categorical and numerical columns are identified and separated.
   - Handling missing values in the 'salary' column using mean imputation.
   - Exploring the distribution of features using count plots and distribution plots.
   - Label encoding categorical variables for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Feature Selection:**
   - Feature importance is evaluated using Extra Trees Classifier and Mutual Information.
   - Top contributing features are selected and visualized.

4. **Model Building:**
   - Decision Tree Classifier is trained, and a cost-complexity pruning path is analyzed.
   - Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are trained.
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using Randomized Search.

5. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy scores of the models are compared on the test dataset.
   - Confusion matrix and heatmap are used to analyze model performance.

6. **Result Visualization:**
   - Probability values for placement and non-placement are extracted.
   - The top contributing features are identified and displayed.

7. **Model Deployment:**
   - The trained Random Forest model is saved for future use.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure required libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn) are installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Placement_Prediction.ipynb`) to reproduce the results.

### Conclusion:

This project provides insights into predicting student placement using machine learning techniques. The Random Forest model demonstrates good accuracy in predicting placement outcomes. Users can leverage the model for placement predictions based on student characteristics.
